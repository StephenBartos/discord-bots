# NOTE: You will probably get errors on the tribesbot container the
#       first time you use `docker compose up`. Simply shut down
#       the containers and then start them up again. They should
#       work after that. I think it has something to do with an
#       uninitialized database in the first run.
#       
#       The database information will be stored in the tribesbot-db
#       volume, which might get renamed to something like
#       `discord-bots_tribesbot-db`. If you are using the Docker
#       installation for a live version of the bot, make sure not
#       to delete this volume!
